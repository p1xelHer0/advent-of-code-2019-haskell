# ✨ Advent of Code 2019 ✨

## My solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

I use [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/) to run the puzzles. In `./src` you will find each puzzle.

### Running puzzles

Puzzles are numbered `{1..25}{ab}`

To run all puzzles:

```
stack run
```

#### Running a single puzzle:

```
./run solve 1a
```

Benchmark the puzzle:

```
./run bench 1a
```

Test the puzzle:

```
./run test 1a
```
