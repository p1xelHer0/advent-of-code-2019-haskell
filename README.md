# ✨ Advent of Code 2019 ✨

> 1AB 2A solved

## My solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

I use [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/) to run the puzzles. In `./src` you will find each puzzle.

The [master](https://github.com/p1xelHer0/advent-of-code-2019-haskell/) branch contains my polished solutions ✨

The [original](https://github.com/p1xelHer0/advent-of-code-2019-haskell/tree/original/) branch contains my unfiltered, original solutions 😱

### Running puzzles

Puzzles are numbered `{1..25}{ab}`

To run all puzzles:

```
stack run
```

#### Running a single puzzle:

```
./run solve 1a
```

Benchmark the puzzle:

```
./run bench 1a
```

Test the puzzle:

```
./run test 1a
```
